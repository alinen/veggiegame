# Attack of the Killer Vegetables

Written in 1998, this is a port of the first game I ever made from a JAVA Applet to HTML/JS. 

Also included is the source of a 2009 remake in ActionScript (aka Flash). For this version, I also created new vector-based assets. 
I no longer have the compiler to build this version.
