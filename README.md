# Attack of the Killer Vegetables

![Original Peapod](https://github.com/alinen/veggiegame/raw/gh-pages/remake-js/docs/peapod.png "Original Peapod")

Written in 1998, this is a port of the first game I ever made from a JAVA Applet to HTML/JS. 

In /actionscript is the source of a 2009 remake in ActionScript (aka Flash). For this version, I also created new vector-based assets. 
I no longer have the build environment setup for this version.
